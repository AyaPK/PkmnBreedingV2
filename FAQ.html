        <h1><u>FAQ:</u></h1>
        <h2>New generation when?</h2>
        <p>Currently this project relies on Pokéapi, which may not yet have new gens or new changed Pokémon.
        </p>

        <h2>Is breeding still accurate for new or changed pokémon?</h2>
        <p>90% of the time, yes. However some Pokémon go get changed on release, and the simulator may not yet use those changes.
            See above question for reasoning.</p>

        <h2>Why not just set up the simulator so that it doesn't rely on Pokéapi?</h2>
        <p>This is a future goal, but it requires server space and hosting and a lot of setup time. I currently don't
            have the time or money to implement this.</p>

        <h2>The Baby Pokémon isn't getting the right moves.</h2>
        <p>That's correct! Right now a baby will just have it's normal level 1 baby moves. The calculations that go in
            to generating the moveset are quite long winded and I am still working on them!</p>

        <h2>Regional form Pokémon?</h2>
        <p>Just append the desired Pokémon's name with the region. E.g. "Raichu-alola" or "Rapidash-Galaria".</p>

        <h2>C'yini luck?</h2>
        <p>An inside joke with a friend of mine who is historically incredibly unlucky with Shiny hunting. This won't be
            in the final release, or will be named something more generic.</p>
